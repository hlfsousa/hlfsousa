My name is Henrique and I'm creating tools in Java, and in 2020 I started my first open source project. I also take great interest in applied Epistemology, and that's my second public project.

If you want to collaborate, feel free to reach out through Skype at hlfsousa. And if you would like me to look into what you are doing, I'm always curious.
